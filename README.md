<h3>Hi there, I'm Camila 👋 </h3>

<h3>Welcome to my digital hub! </h3>

Data analyst in the making. I love coffee, football, cooking and travelling.

As data analyst, I love approaching each project with a researcher's mindset. I recognize that every research case has a story behind it that must be told to uncover meaningful insights. That's why I'm passionate about finding data that will enable informed decision-making and drive positive change.

<h4>Some personal stuff </h4>

- 🚀 I’m currently learning more about Python on Coursera
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on data analysis projects that allow me to put what I've learned into practice and gain experience.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an architect by profession. I know how to build anything from a very small apartment to an office building, and that makes me feel very proud.
- 📖 A life motto I live by is: 'I am here today to cross the swamp, not to fight all the alligators.'
